### Notes

- This repository only contains C++ solutions at the moment. If you have a different approach from ours for any of the problems, or if you have implementation in any language other than C++, feel free to submit a Pull request to this repository.
- The Div1 team presented their solutions for each of the problems at a workshop on October 3rd, 2019. You can access the [Google slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1n2fGakVWnTYoPnRJUzRVHYknUn4qBslko-ULZA48l5g/edit#slide=id.p) with problem descriptions and short solutions.
- Thank you for participating in NP Compete 2019. We look forward to seeing you guys in future events of Compete McGill!
